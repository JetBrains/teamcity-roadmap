# Sidebar
The sidebar is a big part of the [Sakura](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-roadmap/blob/master/Sakura.md) update.

The new pages are based on the master-detail principle; such a structure has a lot of advantages over the previous overview:
* Performance’s now better since we only load the bare minimum
* You can browse projects and build configurations quickly and effortlessly
* Your Favourites ⭐ are easier to manage
* You get a bird-eye view of the status of multiple projects and build 
configurations simultaneously and in one place, even when you have a project or
build configuration currently selected
