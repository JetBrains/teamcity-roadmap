# TeamCity UI Roadmap

This page contains the TeamCity UI roadmap for the upcoming releases. You will get an
insight on features we want to deliver, as well as the philosophy behind them.

TeamCity has been around for more than a decade now. In order to keep up with the ever-evolving needs and standards of our users, we made small, continuous changes to the
TeamCity UI. <br/>
Recently, we decided to roll out **BIG** improvements we have come up with over the years.
Our goal is a flexible, user-friendly, and modern TeamCity UI.

## Our Priorities
 
* Emphasis on the important data on every screen
* Performance and visual appeal
* Scalability: pleasant UX for both small and big installations
* Intuitive navigation
* Improved user workflow

One by one, we are revising all TeamCity UI pages to satisfy our priorities.

## Updates
To make our job of updating TeamCity UI easier, we have split all our pages into groups.
Future releases will revolve around these groups.
 
| Group                                     | Release                  |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| [Overview pages (Sakura)](Sakura.md)      | 2019.1                   |
| [Builds (Sakura)](Builds.md)|2019.2|
| [Agent pages](AgentPages.md)              | 2019.2                   |
| Dashboard              | 2019.2 / 2020.1                   |
| Changes/tests/investigation details pages | 2019.2                   |
| Administration pages                      | 2020.1                   |
| Reporting pages                           | 2020.2                   |
 
Leveraging your feedback and use-case statistics, we decided to focus on the pages you use the most: __Overview__ and __Build Overview__.

After 2019.1, both main and new UI will be available for the next few releases. All the functionality not yet transferred to Sakura will be accessible in the main UI.

## Legend 

Throughout the roadmap we will be using the following legend for the status of each feature:

|  Tag                  |         Meaning      |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| No tag                | In plans   |
| :oncoming_automobile: | In progress |
| :checkered_flag:      | Ready      |
| :x:      |  Currently not planned  |
