#Sakura

'Sakura' is the internal name of our first project. Sakura's focus lies entirely on 
overview and build overview pages. 
Click on any of the headers to track our progress with features related to it.

Throughout the roadmap we use the following legend:

|  Tag                  |         Meaning      |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| No tag                | We planned it        |
| :oncoming_automobile: | We are working on it |
| :checkered_flag:      | We are finished      |

###Sidebar
The redesigned TeamCity overview now includes a sidebar. Hide it whenever you want
detailed information on a project or build configuration, or keep it open to retain 
the big picture.

###Project Overview 
The new overview page will provide you with a bird-eye view of the selected project
giving you information about your latest build configurations and subprojects.
