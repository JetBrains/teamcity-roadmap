# Sakura

'Sakura' is the internal name of our first project. It is the first step towards
[our vision of the new UI](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-roadmap/blob/master/README.md).
Sakura's focus lies entirely on overview and build 
overview pages. <br/>
Click on any of the headers to track the progress with the related features.


### [Sidebar](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-roadmap/blob/master/sidebar.md)
The redesigned TeamCity overview now includes a sidebar. Hide it whenever you want
detailed information on a project or build configuration, or keep it open to retain 
the big picture.

### [Project Overview](https://github.com/JetBrains/teamcity-roadmap/blob/master/ProjectOverview.md)
The new overview page will provide you with a bird-eye view of the selected project
giving you information about your latest build configurations and subprojects.

configuration.
