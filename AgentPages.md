# Agent Pages
All of the __Agent Pages__ will be reworked in the near future. 

At first, we will focus on the pages below: 
* Connected :oncoming_automobile:
* Disconnected :oncoming_automobile:
* Unauthorized :oncoming_automobile:

## Master-Detail Principle 
After getting a lot of positive feedback on the sidebar for our overiew pages, 
we decided to use the same master-detail principle for the __Agent Pages__.

<img src="Images/agent_page.png">

Using the sidebar itself, you will be able to:
* Globally search your agents :oncoming_automobile:
* View agents grouped by pools :oncoming_automobile:
* Check the status of those agents :oncoming_automobile:

Whenever you select an agent in the sidebar, more information on that agent will 
be displayed on the right.
