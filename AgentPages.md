# Agent Pages
The next update will change the structure of the __Agent Pages__. \
After getting a lot of positive feedback on the sidebar for our overiew pages, 
we decided to use the same master-detail principle for the __Agent Pages__.  

## Our Progress

* Sidebar
    * Grouping by pools :checkered_flag: 
    * Connected/disconnected status :checkered_flag: 
    * Idle/active counters :checkered_flag: 
    * Search :checkered_flag: 

## Master-Detail Principle 
The new look is not based around the old connected/disconnected/unauthorized/pools tabs.
The sidebar will provide you with a general overview of all your agents, grouped by pools.

Using the sidebar itself, you will be able to:
* Globally search your agents
* Instantly spot your disconnected agents
* Check the amount of your active/idle agents 

Whenever you select an agent in the sidebar, more information on that agent will 
be displayed on the right.
